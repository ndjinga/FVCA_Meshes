# Conversion of the 3D meshes of the FVCA8 benchmark 
The 3 families of 3D FVCA8 meshes ([Hexahedra](3DHexahedra), [Prisms](3DPrism) and [Tetrahedra](3DTetrahedra)) were available in the .msh format. We therefore opened them with the software [GMSH](http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#MSH-ASCII-file-format) and exported them in the MED (.med) format.  
We also added two extra folders containing tetrahedra meshes similar but not identical to those of the FVCA8 3D tetrahedra benchmark. The [Tetrahedra_icem](3DTetrahedra_icem) family was generated with ANSYS-ICEM, whilst the [Tetrahedra_structured](3DTetrahedra_structured) family has right angles and was generated with [Trust platform](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code).
