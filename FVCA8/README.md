# Meshes of the benchmark of the FVCA8 Conference
Content is originally from [F. Boyer and P. Omn√®s](https://github.com/FranckBoyer/FVCA8_Benchmark).  

## Presentation

This benchmark aims at comparing the accuracy, robustness, complexity of modern finite volume methods on unstructured grids in the context of viscous incompressible flows computations (Stokes and/or Navier-Stokes equations).

It was proposed in the occasion of the [Eighth Conference on Finite Volumes for Complex Applications - FVCA8](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/1299/) held in Lille (France) from June 12th to June 16th 2017.

## Definition of the benchmark

All the necessary informations on the proposed test cases and the expected outputs are given in the [PDF file](OriginalBenchmark/Benchmark.pdf)

The 2D and 3D meshes are available in their original format [here](OriginalBenchmark), and in MED format [here](MEDFiles).
