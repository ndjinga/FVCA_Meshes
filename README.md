Archive of FVCA meshes and scripts to convert them into MED file format

FVCA5 conference held in France in 2008 introduced a benchmark for the diffusion equation on various 2D meshes (see https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/fvca5/).  

FVCA6 conference held in Prague in 2011 proposed a new benchmark for the diffusion equation on various 3D meshes this time (see http://fvca6.fs.cvut.cz/).

FVCA8 conference held in France in 2017 introduced a new benchmark for the Navier-Stokes equations on various 2D and 3D meshes (see https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/1299/).  

Some of the meshes used in these three conference benchmark are no longer available online. We regroup them in a single repository and propose python scripts to convert them into MED file format (see https://www.salome-platform.org/user-section/about/med).
