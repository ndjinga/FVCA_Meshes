## The different meshes

All of these meshes are discretizations of the domain [0,1]^2 
 
 * `mesh1_i` is a classical triangular mesh. `mesh1_i` has been obtained by duplication of `mesh1_0`.
 * `mesh2_i` is a uniform rectangular mesh. The mesh size of `mesh2_i` is equal to 2^{-i-1}.
 * `mesh3_i` is rectangle mesh locally refined in the neighbourhood of (0,0). `mesh3_i` has been obtained by refinement of `mesh3_0`.
 * `mesh4_i` is a quadrangle mesh with acute angles.
 * `mesh5_i` is a nonconforming rectangular mesh for the vertical fault problem.
 * `mesh6` is  a conforming distorted quadrangle mesh
 * `mesh7` is  a nonconforming distorted quadrangle mesh
 
## The format of the meshes

We provide two different formats for the meshes

 `.typ1` and `.typ2`


### Format .typ1 (triangular or quadrangular control volumes) includes
 * the  total number of vertices
 * the coordinates of the vertices   
 * the total number of triangles
 * the number of each of their three vertices ordered clockwise
 * the total number of quadrangles
 * the number of each of their four vertices ordered clockwise
 * the total number of edges on the boundary of the domain
 * the number of the vertices that define such edge
 * the total number of all the edges ( intersection of two control volumes or of a control volume and the boundary of the domain)
 * informations on each edge
    * the number of the two vertices of the edge 
    * the number of the two control volumes  defining the edge or for the boundary the "numero" of the control volume and 0
 


### Format .typ2 (polygonal control volumes) gives
 * the  total number of vertices
 * the coordinates of the vertices
 * the number of control volumes
 * the control volumes with
   * the total number of vertices on the boundary of volume
   * the number of each of their vertices ordered clockwise

 
## Example:
We consider a mesh named test with 3 control volumes `[0,0.5]*[0.1], [0.5,1]*[0,0.5],[0.5,1]*[0.5,1]`
