# Meshes of the benchmark of the FVCA8 Conference
Content is originally from R. Herbin and F. Hubert (see [PDF file](./OriginalMeshes/Benchmark.pdf) or original [website](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/fvca5/benchmark/index.html)).  

The 2D meshes were converted to MED format using the [python script](./MEDFiles/convert_2Dmsh_to_med.py).  

## Presentation

The aim of this benchmark was to provide a number of test cases in order to compare the properties (convergence, robustness...) of existing discretization schemes for anisotropic diffusion problems on general possibly nonconforming  2D meshe.  
It was proposed in the occasion of the [Fifth International Symposium on Finite Volumes for Complex Applications - FVCA5](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/fvca5/benchmark/index.html) held in Aussois (France) from June 8th to June 13th 2008.

## Definition of the benchmark

All the necessary informations on the proposed test cases and the expected outputs are given in the [PDF file](./OriginalMeshes/Benchmark.pdf)

The 2D meshes are available in the [original format](OriginalMeshes) and in [MED format](MEDFiles).
